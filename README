 Java Message Translator
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Java Message Translator is a Web based i18n property file
  editor. When working with Java applications that need to be
  translated, it can be difficult to keep all the .properties-files
  up-to-date, as the translations usually need to be done by someone
  else, probably in another country.

  It is in an early stages of development, but I have successfully
  used it for a project already.


  BUILDING AND DEVELOPING:
  ========================

  To build the project, make sure you have Maven installed, and in the
  project root folder type:

    mvn package

  This will download all the jar dependencies, and you will end up
  with a war-file in the target/ folder.

  If you want to create Eclipse project files, simply type:

    mvn eclipse:eclipse

  If you just want to test the application, start it up in a local
  Tomcat container by typing:

    mvn tomcat:run


  It may not be necessary, but I highly recommend installing a Maven
  plugin for Eclipse. For example this one:

    http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/

  Finally, since Spring Roo has been used, it's probably a good idea
  to install that as well. See:
